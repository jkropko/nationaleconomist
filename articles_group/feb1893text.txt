T1iis

to
me
when 1 became a member of this
order, that m- political orreligious
rghts should not be interferedwith.
Grádually, for the last two years,
has partisanism been gaining power
and influence in the order, and
unless the tendericy is checked the
rarmers Alliance and Industrial
Union, the one proud hope of the
oppressed agriiltra1 and iabbring
classes, wi1l falll,into the bands
ofts enemies.
Ambtioiis parti-
saris and designing demogogues;
regardless of its nol1e
eachings,
will,
by unfair means,
assume
control óf its organizations and
:ek to force it to becorne the mere
:oo1 of .a petty political faction
without well defined principies,
evér ready and willing to cast its
fortunes with any political party
for a division of the spoils of
office.
Were further evideice necessary
to convince even the most doubt-
ing memberof the order of the
truth of my conclusions as to this
scheme, 1 need but refer to the
recent perman.ent organization of
the industrial legion by the popu-
lites with Gen. Paul Vandervoort
as commander-in-chief. This order
or secret oath bound political mili-
tary organization admits none to
membership except such as sub-
scribe to the Omaha platforrn and
declares as its object the control of
the political interest of the Farm-
ers Alliance and Industrial Union.
It will also he remembered t1at
thisorganization was temporarily
organized at Meniphis while the
&ipfeme Coüncil was being heid.
Believing, theFéfi., as 1 must,
from proof so .conc1ive, that the
Alliance, if perverted aud subordi-
nated to partisan political pur-
poses is rio longer in harmony with
the interests of the laboring and
farming people, and utterly pow-
erless to have any irifluence with
either of the oid parties to secure
the relief it seeks and deserves
fróm the oppressions and hard-
ships
imposeci by class
laws.
If the poor people have to wait
until the People's party get into
power' they will starve to death.

This'is why
