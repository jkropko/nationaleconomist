Under this sub-treasury plan the,
difference that now goes iñto tite pocket of tite spec-
ulator will go into thé pocketof- tite producer, while
the consumer will iiot pay Que single ccitt more.
- Another objection that- 1, have heard, and titat 1
may, as well answer, is this: Titat we will be able to
forrn a trust ór combination oit tite part of tle farm-
ers of the óountry.- There are two reasons why we
can, not do that.
Mcii niust be trae tó their own iii-
terests, ami to their'own nature and to théi own 1w.
stiucts.
The business teñdency of tite farmer is' to
'rush'his crop imito tite market as qukkly as possible.
If there is a risc- of one-eigitth of a ceút apund en
cotton one day, everyplanter will hitch up bis teain
next morning iii order to secure tite advantage of that
one-eigitth of a ceut.
He is afraid tliat-the increase
will be gone tite next day.
There is anotiter reason
why fa,rmer' can not, under this. plan, pat a comer on
their produce.. We are limited under, this bili to
twelve'months, while under tite bankiiig sytem the
charter runs for twenty years. Wc know that if we
undrtake a comer it will lap over imito the next erop;
so thiaV we dare not do it.
It is att absurdity oit its
