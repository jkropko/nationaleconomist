, Wc have a letter froni our friend ,
1 Mr. G O. SiiieI4s, the well-known
and popular author, written from the
town óf Ediy, New Mexico, gi'ing
,, an
interesting
description of the
country which ve quote be1ow. There
are more productive lands yet ttnde-
veloped in this country than sorne of
qicflS would have us be-
iieve.
It will 'b more than onth±
decade before :we shall consume alt
the wheat we can grow; it will be
more than ,a century.
The valley
wbich Mr. Shiclds describes can sup-
port a population equal to that df

greater and a grander countrythan

der wiser and nore progressive gov-
ernrnent is destined to becomç thc

world has at present no realizaion
and no adequate coúception.
Th
fotlowing is Mr. Shields' description
We have here one of the most fertil
valleys in thi world.
it is 30 tO 4ó mlle
