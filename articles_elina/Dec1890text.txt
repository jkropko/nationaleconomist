ny MRS. 1..M. RING, BANAxÁ, 1T.Á.
With much pleasure 1 return
Ms. Wardall's sympathetic greet-
ing to myself in a late number of
'FUE ECONOMiST.
1 feel that our
aims are one.
Let men and wo
men stand toÉether, shonider to
shoulder, fairly, equally, socially,
financiafly and pólitically.
1 feel
also thatour desire for this advancé
.
.
is the same iii both.
Itis for the
:
good of al!. As a woman, 1 desire
the. advance of wometi only in so
far as they maybring with them a
better and higher morality. As a
.
farmer, 1 desire the advanee of
farmers .only in so far as they may
bring with them greater truth and
honesty.
If womn and farmers
mingle with, and work in the fi-
naúcia1and politica1
.spheres oñly
to çarry on and strengthen the
present systems of fratid, greed and
.chicanery ah hope for a brighter
futurre in America and the world
seems bumanly impossible.
The
positions áf women aud farmers are
very similar.
Both are
rodticers,;
.
ne of inankind,the other of tIte
sustenance of niankind:
Both,
until lately, have been isolated,
the
woman
in
her
borne,
the farmer on his farm,and it has
been said of both that they can
,
nçt combine. Both have been toid
ad nausea that the their immediate
surrouudings are tbeir "sphere,
in which they are to toil unremit-
ingly aud not " meddle with poli-'
tics."
Both until
still recently
have been totaily ignorant of the
science of money or finance, aud
both ti3' the " power of the purse "
llave been ruled and kept in sube
jectión.
Besides this, there is no
profession in which the man and
the woman havé so laborionaly
workd side hy side and shoulder
to shonlder as in farming.
Both
classes have been kept in a meas-
ure from the worldthe world of
the financier aud the politician
and are, therefore, at present free
from the taint of the vices now al-
moSt become ingrained in these
exclusively
masculine
systems.
Therefore they can enter them
with clean hands, and God grant
that tbey enter them with justice
iii their hearts and a clear insight,
resolved not to tau iii with, pr.,suc-
comb to the vicious inuences
which will encompass them, but to
conquer theni and be the ultimate
means of saving their country and
the world;
These are big words,
but none too big for the great cause
at stake.
,
- 1 What. the fatmers will achieve
may be judged of by their first
fruits.
Are thjy golng to be .just
to their female coworkers ? Have
they insight énough to see what

what they can and will be to theni
