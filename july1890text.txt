s Harrls,
Carlisle and Milis against him, but we rejoice to know that
this rising young.stateslnaú has opinlons o bis' own and the
couzge to advocate them. Senator Harris is an oid man of
a±nowiedged ability and has been in the United States,
Senatefor fourteen years, but if he has ever introduced. one
single bili to prevent combinations of capítal, reducing the
prices ofthe 'pro4ucts of the soil below the natural iaw of

Harris la a fair sample of our leaders whóm we hayo trusted

It is

not surprising then that the eop1e should desire azid lool
fór new leadera who caúgrasp the situation and apply the
remedy? The friends of monopoly will no doubt wake war
upon Mr;Pierce for -lila houst opinloa on the

DilAn Sm : You will rernembr thatthebanks of thi City of

reasurer of the,
Tinited Stateá'tlíe simm óf $S,9i5,000'in goid, receiviñg in ez-

time, though,active efforts iave bei
dtdistribiite it-
through tite copntry, as our origaal intention wasin mak-
ihg, the:deposit,
have beenunableto do so by reason of
the 'competition of the' T-reasury, which pays the-express
transportaticn, to aU interior points. This has operated as
an eflectual bar- to anj attempt on, our ,part to 'effect ,the
sanie urpose. We submit, therefore, that we bepermitted,
-
toavail ourselves of aright which ive posse,ss by the temis
of the law in regaTrd to tliUrédéptión of thTftactional
coin, 'and tliat we deposit ja the Assistant ireasury' at New
York the sum of, say $4,500,000, (or4,000,000, as'you, ja your'
judgment,, may déem best,) and. receive in enchange there-
for either silver dohlars, silver certificates, or stih other
fon
of currency as you nlay deem advisable. la niaking
this proposal
e do not propose to -waive any of our legal
nights ja thé matter, but to carry out, as far as practicable,
our.original intention; which was to,aid the Treasury ja re-,
tahiing its goid balance, in order that the business of, the
city, of, New York- should be kept exclusively upoú a goid
basis as between the Govemnfnent aud the banks.
We see from' the
resent condition, of the Treasury ño
cause for apprehenston of ita not having gold enough for
sorne, time to come, ami while making the abov-nequest Can
only -reiterate our entine wihlingness ta again come to the
aid. óf the (lovemnrnent, whenever, la the opinion' of- the

order to protect the banking interests of this city, and
through them the financiál and'commercial interests of the
